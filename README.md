# HMIS
R functions that will help HMIS (Homeless Management Information Systems, as defined by the US Dept of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)) admins work with homeless services data.

# Instructions
- In the console, run the following:
  ```
  install.packages("devtools") # if this is already installed, you can skip this step.
  
  devtools::install_github("kiadso/HMIS")
  ```
- If you get a prompt that you need to update some packages first, type 1 (All)
- Let all the processes complete (it might take some time) and it should be done.
